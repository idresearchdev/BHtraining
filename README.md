Effective Python Penetration Testing - Python is a powerful new-age scripting platform that allows you to build exploits, evaluate services, automate, and link solutions with ease. Penetration testing is a practice of testing a computer system, network, or web application to find weaknesses in security that an attacker can exploit. Because of the power and flexibility offered by it, Python has become one of the most popular languages used for penetration testing.
All topics in this course have been covered in individual modules so that you
develop your skill after the completion of a module and get ready for the next. Through this comprehensive course, you'll learn how to use Python for pen-testing techniques from scratch to finish!
The course also covers the industry standards such as OWASP Top 10 and contain numerous real life examples to help the attendees understand the true impact of these vulnerabilities. This course is constantly updated on a regular basis to ensure that the latest exploits and vulnerabilities are available within the Appfabs and taught in this course and you will get an idea of how a penetration tester can use these tools and libraries to aid his or her day-to-day work.
